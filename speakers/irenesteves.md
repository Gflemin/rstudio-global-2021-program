# The dynamic duo: SQL & R

There’s a point in every data wrangler’s career in which their full dataset can no longer fit into just CSV files, and the journey to database-world begins.  I reached this point about two years ago, when I transitioned from ecological research to the world of eCommerce fraud prevention.  My calls to read_csv became scarcer as I came to rely more and more on databases.  In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how I incorporate R and SQL into my daily workflow, aided by features in RStudio IDE .  I’ll also discuss our company’s “riskiconn” package for handling database connections and queries, and how this package was a key tool during our migration to a new database service.
