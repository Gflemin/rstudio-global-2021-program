# Not the Presentation We Deserve. The Presentation We Need: Merck Puts GxP Shiny App into Production

In Feb 2020, Merck manufacturing officially launched a Shiny app into production. That’s right – the almighty, coveted production.  Feature-wise, the app is not particularly special. Users enter a few inputs and out pops a PDF with charts and tables. 

What mattered was the app was in production AND approved for GMP use.  This meant the analyses could be submitted to the FDA. While this talk will cover many challenges of moving into production (e.g. defining “production”), notably it will offer further proof that it can be done. When faced with the unfounded “R can’t be used in production”, users will have one more card to play: Merck uses R. 

It may not be the robust argument users deserve, but it may be the concise retort they need.
