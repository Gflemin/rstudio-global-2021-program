# Making .pot-ery with R: Translations in R Packages

The R community is globally distributed and R itself is available with messages in 14 languages. Adding translations for non-native English-speaking users of your package can ease their experience and empower them to build better things with less frustration (though please note that "object of type 'closure' is not subsettable" is equally inscrutable in all human languages). 

In this talk, I will cover translations in R packages -- how to implement them, why to do so, and how to maintain them. This will summarize and extend learnings based on our experience adding Mandarin translations to data.table and culminating in the potools package (WIP).
