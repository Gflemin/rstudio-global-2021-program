# Building Interpretable Modeling Pipelines with tidymodels, iml, and drake

Although modeling techniques like XGBoost or neural networks often perform better than linear models on prediction tasks, these approaches are non-transparent “black boxes” that are unable to produce explanations for their  predictions. As a result, biases or fairness issues in training data can sneak into, and be magnified by, our models, leading to harmful, incorrect predictions. What if we could achieve both the predictive performance of black box models as well as much of the transparency of linear models? In this talk, I will discuss the concept of model interpretability and how it can be achieved for “black box” models in R using the iml, tidymodels, and drake packages to create more transparent, less harmful modeling pipelines.
