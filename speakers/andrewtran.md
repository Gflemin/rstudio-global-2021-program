# Big pharmacy data: Using R to help turn data over to the public

This talk will go over how The Washington Post used R to analyze hundreds of gigs of data from the DEA as part of its investigation into the opioid epidemic. 

* Dealing with big data in R with doparallel
* Exploratory visualizations and mapping with various packages like RLeaflet and geofacet
* Making an API with janitor for easier data distribution
* Making an R package on top of the API for documentation and vignettes
* Inspiring the creation of a Python library on top of the API to access ARCOS data
* Updating the package so that all parts of the data can be used that will hopefully inspire others to go further than the Post
