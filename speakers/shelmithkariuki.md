# rKenyaCensus Package

The rKenyaCensus package contains the results of the 2109 Kenya Population Census.The data was published in PDF files, and hence there was a need to make it accessible. This data has been used by the Kenya Red Cross team to examine counties that are Covid19 high risk areas. It can also be used by the government for data driven policy making.I used the data to develop a shiny dashboard that tracks the progress that Kenya has made towards achieving the SDGs. During the exercise, I learnt how to develop a robust package and  enhance the UI of a shiny dashboard using html and CSS. I believe that this package will encourage national statistical organisations to enhance the spirit of open data through publishing their data openly (and easily).
