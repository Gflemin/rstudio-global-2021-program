# Towards an integrated {verse}: lessons learned developing a library of validated packages

Developing R packages as a unified {verse} – a set of packages that work well together but with each focusing on individual tasks – is an efficient strategy to structure support for complex workflows. The ongoing challenge becomes managing the growth of related packages in a holistic manner. This is especially problematic in industries with a heavy emphasis on stability, for example if packages need to be validated prior to use in production. In this talk, I will discuss a paradigm for developing and maintaining validated R packages, emphasizing the following areas: (1) strategies for organizing packages to prevent excessive re-work (2) facilitating responsive, iterative development and (3) empathy for developer and user experiences.
