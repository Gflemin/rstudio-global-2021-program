# Accessible Data Science Beyond Visual Models

Data science is full of vision-dominant practices, and most data scientists rely heavily on visual models. 

However, data science itself should require insight and computational thinking beyond what is just seen by eyes.

JooYoung Seo, who is a blind data scientist and who was working for RStudio's accessibility projects over the summer 2020, will talk about his experience with some non-visual techniques to interact with data.

If you would like to know more about various ways of making data science accessible via R, and new accessibility features introduced in RStudio IDE and Shiny, his demonstration without sight will be thought-provoking.
