# Automagic image creation and translation

Automation. Reproducibility. Accessibility. Data driven. These are not concepts one would associate with the publishing industry, where designers traditionally produce every artefact manually using proprietary software.

With the tidyverse tools in our back pocket, we rose to the challenge to revolutionize this workflow. We collaborated with a bespoke, modern publishing group to develop a system to automatically generate figures for openly-licensed textbooks. The system derives figure contents from data and generates translations into several languages. 

This project also advances the open education agenda of enabling educators and students to re-use content for their own purposes whilst at the same time teaching R and coding skills.
