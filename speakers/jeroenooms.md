# The rOpenSci build infrastructure

Over the past year we have been improving the rOpenSci development infrastructure to provide an array services for users and maintainers of rOpenSci packages, and also for the rOpenSci editorial team to monitor the activity and health of projects in our organization.

This talk will discuss some of these tools, such as our docs server which hosts ropensci themed pkgdown documentation for all packages, and our new package server, which automatically builds the source and binary packages for all rOpenSci projects.

More generally, I hope to show how centralizing these processes to the level of the organization can help to make the R packages easier to find and install, while reducing the maintenance load for individual package authors.
